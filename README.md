# Heart_Failure_Survival_using_Voting_Classifier
This project is extension of https://github.com/deveshpatel0101/heart-failure-patients-survival and partly implementation of IEEE paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9370099) with title "Improving the Prediction of Heart Failure Patientsâ€™ Survival Using SMOTE and Effective Data Mining Techniques" .

Here Voting classifier is created using five classifiers namely
1. Decision Tree
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Extra Tree Classifier
4. Logistic Regression
5. Random Forest

   
They are choosen due to their high performance scores

To run the code, follow the instructions from original repository
